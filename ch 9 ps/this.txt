I'm sorry, but it seems there might be a misunderstanding in your request. 
As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I don't have any information on an author
named William Douglas or a work titled "Deep Water" by that author. It's possible that there
might be a mistake in the name or title, or it could be a work that emerged after my last update.
