# this command help us to identify which class of varible is in consideration
# type()

 
a = 3
print(type(a)) # class int

b = "31.2" # this is a string since double quotation is used
print(type(b))

# to change varible b to class float use float() -> it is a function
# provided it should be legal eg Miyoko can not be converted into int
c = float(b)

print(type(c))
