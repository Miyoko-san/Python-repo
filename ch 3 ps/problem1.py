#write a program to ask user name followed a good fternoon text

a = input("Please enter your name : ")
print("Good Afternoon",a)

# a better/new way to do this is 
print(f"Good Afternoon {a}")  #f variable is assigned to print command (only f can be used for this specific use)
# using this we can directly use a string varible using curly bracket {}
